# Python Milestone Part B - Unique Replacement

VALUE: 10 points
DUE: October 14, 2022

Write a program called unique.py that duplicates some of the functionality of the uniq system utility.  Except unlike uniq, your program should not require that input be sorted first.

    $ ./unique.py -h
    Usage: unique.py [flags]

        -c      Prefix lines by the number of occurrences
        -d      Only print duplicate lines
        -i      Ignore differences in case when comparing, prints out full line in lowercase
        -u      Only print unique lines

    By default, unique.py prints one of each type of line.

(The format of your help message may differ slightly.  Just use argparse.)

## Example

Given the file dinosaur.txt:

    tyrannosaur
    stegosaur
    Allosaur
    allosaur
    allosaur
    tyrannosaur
    
Here are examples of output:
    
    $ cat dinosaur.txt | ./unique.py
    tyrannosaur
    stegosaur
    Allosaur
    allosaur

    $ cat dinosaur.txt | ./unique.py -i -c -d
    2 tyrannosaur
    3 allosaur

    $ cat dinosaur.txt | ./unique.py -u
    stegosaur
    Allosaur
    
    $ cat dinosaur.txt | ./unique.py -d -i
    tyrannosaur
    allosaur

    $ cat dinosaur.txt | ./unique.py -c -i
    2 tyrannosaur
    1 stegosaur
    3 allosaur

## Formatting

Your script should not do any special formatting, except for the -c flag.  If the -c flag is not specified, just output the lines on the console as shown above.

If the -c flag is specified, print out the number of occurrences, then a space, then the line.  Do not put whitespace before the number (like the "real" uniq utility does).
    
## Grading

I provide a test script called m2btest.sh, similar to the dailies.  However, I will have another two or three files besides just dinosaur.txt.  Part of the challenge of the assignment is testing your code on arbitrary inputs such as your own test cases, to be sure it is working how you expect, rather than relying only on the test script.

## Tips

The default behavior cries out for the use of a dictionary.  You can just stick all lines into a dictionary, then get the list of keys from the dictionary to generate the output.

The -c flag also means a dictionary is pretty useful.  The values of the dictionary should be the number of times that key is in the file.

## Special Thanks

Special Thanks to Peter Bui for this assignment.  It is the only one borrowed from the "other" version of Systems Programming. :-)
