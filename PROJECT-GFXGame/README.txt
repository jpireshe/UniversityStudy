This is Project NUGHI, by Joao Henares. I wanted to leave some instructions about how the game works here.

By starting the game, you are prompted to click the screen and enter the gameplay loop.

In the gameplay loop, you control the green and pink ship, with the name NUGHI right above you.
You have to dodge the blue and red spaceships. If they touch you, you lose the game. By losing the game,
you can press R to restart. You can pause by pressing P. You can move by HOLDING keys W,A,S and D.
You can shoot if you press SPACE, but it takes some time to reload (see the reload bar). Any enemies 
the laser touches will be eliminated.

If your score surpasses 1000, you will see a new kind of enemy, the pink and yellow mover. 
There are two little power up tokens once in a while in your screen. The light blue ball with the 
"A" symbol will give you more speed. The orange ball with "F" symbol will make you reload your laser 
shots faster. 

If you get a nice score, it may go to the top 5 scores and be saved throughout your sessions. You can see them
by inputing H on the menu screen. If you try to do that, however, when you START the game (and have not clicked
the xming window) you need to click on top of the window (and not on the screen because that starts the game)
and then click H.
